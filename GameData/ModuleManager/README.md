# Module Manager /L
*Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate*
- - -

ModuleManager is a mod that let you write patches that edit other parts at load time.

This is Lisias' fork for Module Manager, and it's intended to bring functionality and performant improvements to ModuleManager - with great to moderate success being achieved toward these goals (most of the time!), as well others not mentioned here.

Backwards compatibility is guaranteed - including functional bugs on `Module Manager - Forum`. `MM/L`'s patching output will be always the same as `Module Manager - Forum`, salvo new (and optional) features when not present on `Module Manager - Forum`.

Development for this fork is ongoing and, as such, subject to some screw ups now and then. **AVOID** Pre Releases unless you are willing to help me debug this thing (check for `Pre Release` markings before downloading).

Please, **DO NOT** submit bug reports/issues to the [References](#references) (see the bottom of this document), as this is an EXPERIMENTAL/WIP version of `ModuleManger - Forum` being developed in parallel and separately from the Forum version.

Necessarily, `MM/L` will receive **no support** from the maintainers of `ModuleManger - Forum`, as well from some 3rd parties that may choose to support `ModuleManger - Forum` only. Some others (and myself), on the other hand, **will** actively support `MM/L`. Check your add'ons documentation (or politely ask us directly) for more information.

Please, **DO** submit bug reports/issues to the links depicted on the next section of this document.
